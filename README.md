More details available in the upcoming YouTube Video.

The principles for this design are:
1. Have a shower while on multi-day overlanding trips
2. Use the proven Yakima shower tank (I used the "MD" 7 gal variant, although I had to shorten it by ~15 cm to match the width of my tent)
3. Pick a monting point such that the weight impact on the car handling is minimal while maintaining good exposure to sunlight

The bracket is in two parts. the bottom one slides in the tent mounting rails. The top one goes inside the tent as a reinforcement. The construction was successfully tested on a 3000 km road trip (~500 km offroad / gravel) to Balkans in August 2023.
